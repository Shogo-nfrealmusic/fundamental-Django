      1. Rapid Development: • Django promotes rapid development and clean,
      pragmatic design. Its “batteries-included” philosophy means it comes with
      many built-in features and libraries that speed up the development
      process. 2. Security: • Django includes many security features to help
      developers avoid common security mistakes. It protects against SQL
      injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF),
      and clickjacking. 3. Scalability: • Django is designed to help developers
      build scalable applications. Its architecture and components (like the
      ORM, caching mechanisms, and middleware) allow for building large-scale
      applications. 4. Versatility: • Django is versatile and can be used to
      build various types of applications, from content management systems and
      social networks to scientific computing platforms and financial
      applications. 5. Admin Interface: • Django provides a robust and
      customizable admin interface out of the box, allowing for easy content
      management and administration tasks. 6. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): •
      Django’s ORM lets developers interact with databases using Python code
      instead of SQL, making database operations more intuitive and less
      error-prone. 7. Community and Documentation: • Django has a large, active
      community and extensive, high-quality documentation. This makes it easier
      to find solutions to problems and learn the framework. 8. Built-in
      Authentication: • Django comes with a built-in authentication system,
      which simplifies user management tasks like login, logout, password
      management, and permissions. • Django’s monolithic nature can be a
      disadvantage for some projects. It enforces a certain project structure
      and components, which can be limiting if you prefer more flexibility or
      want to use different tools. 2. Performance Overhead: • Django can
      introduce performance overhead due to its abstraction layers and built-in
      features. For applications requiring high performance and low latency,
      this can be a drawback. 3. Learning Curve: • Although Django’s
      documentation is excellent, its comprehensive feature set and conventions
      can present a steep learning curve for beginners, especially those new to
      web development or Python. 4. Not Ideal for Small Projects: • For very
      small projects or simple applications, Django might be overkill. Its
      powerful features and abstractions can add unnecessary complexity. 5.
      Opinionated Framework: • Django is an opinionated framework, meaning it
      enforces certain ways of doing things. While this can be beneficial for
      consistency, it can be restrictive for developers who prefer other methods
      or frameworks. 6. Template Language Limitations: • Django’s template
      language, while powerful, can be limiting for complex front-end logic.
      Developers might find it less flexible compared to other templating
      engines or front-end frameworks. 7. ORM Limitations: • While Django’s ORM
      is powerful, it might not be suitable for complex database queries and
      operations. Developers might need to write raw SQL for certain tasks,
      which can reduce the benefits of using the ORM.
